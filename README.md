# Problem Solving

![Header](media/pic01.jpg)

This repository is not Language-based. You can find practices dedicated to each language on my profile. But here, it's all about problem-solving. The ways to solve each problem. I'll try my best to come back and improve my answers.

Some of my resources are:

* [CoderByte](https://coderbyte.com/challenges "Link")
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard "Link")
* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com "Link")

If you want to focus on learning a specific **programming language**, I recommend [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks "Link").

## **Daily Update**

> * Day 1
>   * LeetCode - Two Sum - Java - Iteration 1

I'm a beginner and this is my plan to improve my problem-solving skills. So each day, I try to solve a problem in an hour or less. If it takes more than that, I just commit all I've done until that point. You can follow along or you can find the codes based on their provider.
